# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

None of them are arrays. NodeLists are similar to arrays but can only use the `forEach` method, these can contain anything within the html document. HTMLCollections do not have any methods and can only have html elements. It is also preferably not to use HTMLCollections because these have live updates which can lead to bugs.
