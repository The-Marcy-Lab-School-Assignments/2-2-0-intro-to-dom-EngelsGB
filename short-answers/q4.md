# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

I would use `.innerHTML` if I want to include more than one line of html and `.createElement` if I'm creating a single element or a series of elements that can be created using iteration.
